Concrete Crack Classifier 

This repo contains a jupyter notebook that provides an in-depth workflow for creating a simple CNN to 
identify cracks in images of concrete using Tensorflow. The notebook also contains instructions on how 
to get the data.

The environment used to build the model is documented in the environments.yml file.
